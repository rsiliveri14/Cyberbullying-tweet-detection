**üõ°Ô∏è Cyberbullying Tweet Detection**

Detecting cyberbullying is essential in today's digital age, where social media platforms are frequently used for harassment and abuse. This project leverages **Natural Language** **Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to automatically classify tweets based on their textual content as cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying.

**üìå Features**

* Preprocessing of tweet text (stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization)  
* Feature extraction using TF-IDF  
* Model training using:  
  * Decision Tree (achieved 97.92% accuracy)  
  * Random Forest  
  * K-Nearest Neighbors  
  * Support Vector Machine  
* Performance evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
* Model serialization using joblib for deployment-ready predictions

**üöÄ Getting Started** 

1. **Clone the repository**  
   git clone [https://github.com/rsiliveri14/Cyberbullying-tweet-detection.git](https://github.com/rsiliveri14/Cyberbullying-tweet-detection.git)
   cd Cyberbullying-tweet-detection

2. **Install dependencies**  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt  
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**  
   jupyter notebook Notebooks/Cyberbullying\_Detection.ipynb  
4. **Run prediction via script**  
   python main.py
